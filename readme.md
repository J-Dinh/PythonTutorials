I plan to use this folder to hold my documents for Github.
I created the folder by creating a folder on the home directory by using *mkdir git*.
Then I changed directory to git using *cd git*.
After, I created a new file using *New-Item readme.md*.
I learned how to do this is PSY341K in the fourth tutorial.
